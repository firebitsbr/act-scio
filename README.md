# scio-back

## Requirements

SCIO requires a working clojure environment to build and beanstalkd/java to run.

### Beanstalkd

The scio platform uses the beanstalkd mq. This must be installed and running.

## Installation

### Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-scio.git
cd act-scio
```

### Download vendor files to vendor/ (OpenNLP models, Geo names and TLDs)

```bash

script/get-vendor-files.sh
```

### To run locally

In repository, run this command to replace all directories in ini-file to point to our local repository.

This is also needed to run the tests.

```bash
sed "s#/opt/scio#$(pwd)#g" etc/scio.ini > etc/scio.ini.local
```

Create directoy for storing documents.

```bash
mkdir documents
```

### System wide installation: copy files

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/scio/documents
cp -r etc vendor /opt/scio
```

### To build

```bash
lein uberjar
lein test
```

## Testing

```bash
lein test
```

## Usage


```bash
java -jar ./target/uberjar/scio-back-[VERSION]-standalone.jar --config etc/scio.ini.local
```

Config file defaults to /etc/scio.ini if not specified.
